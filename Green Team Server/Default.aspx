        <h1>Green Team</h1>
        <p class="lead">The Green Team is a club whose purpose is to promote sustainability within our school and community environment. We do this by organizing school cleanups, recycling drives, and a monthly trail cleanup at a local park. One of our biggest accomplishments so far has been raising money to install a new water bottle refill station to reduce waste from disposable water bottles.</p>
