    <h3>Think Globally, Act Locally</h3>
    <p>The BC green games is an eco-storytelling contest held each year by Science World for grades K-12. Schools from across the province participate in this annual contest to share their ambitions for an environmentally friendly world and to compete for cash prizes that will help them reach their goal. Since the creation of Green Team, we have been actively showcasing our solid ambition for environmental awareness and demonstrating our ability to be the change in our community each year on BC Green Games. We won Viewer's choice awards for 3rd place in 2016 and 1st place in 2017. </p>
